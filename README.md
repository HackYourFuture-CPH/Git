# Git :
This repository contains the course material for the Git modules :octocat:.

Git course was first introduced in the Hack Your Future (HYF henceforth) in September 2016. We think that learning Git is one of the useful skills to become a successful and efficient software engineer. The aim of this course is to learn the basics of Git and not to be an expert. Both Git1 and Git2 are designed to be run as one session each.

We want to use this repository as an archive of course material (slides/tutorials), useful resources, teaching ideas etc.
