# Hand in your homework

### TL;DR

- Checkout from `main` to your homework branch;
- Complete your homework in the relevant folder(s);
- Go through the [homework checklist](#homework-checklist);
- Create a pull request using the homework branch and give your PR the same name as the homework branch. <br/>
  For example, for javascript1 week2 homework, you would create a pull request to merge the branch `javascript-javascript1-week2` to the branch `main` and the pull request would be called ‚Äújavascript-javascript1-week2‚Äù;
- Share the link to the pull request in your class channel;
- Wait for mentor and / or peer feedback;
- Once feedback is received, make sure you are at your homework branch, implement the mentor feedback. `add`, `commit`, and `push` the changes;
- Merge your pull request;
- Do a celebratory dance! üíÉüèªüï∫üèΩüéâ

## Before starting the homework

Get into the hyf-homework repo and run `git status` in the terminal.

‚ùó If there are changes that have not been committed, figure out what to do with those changes. Don't just start a new homework before this is resolved.

Don't worry if you are confused! Ask your classmates or post in the `#git-support` channel on slack!

When your git status replies with "nothing to commit, working tree clean", you are ready to create the branch for this weeks homework.

### Creating the branch

‚ùóAlways check out to the new branch from `main`. If you check out to the new branch from some other branch, you might bring along unwanted and unrelated commits.

Every week, your homework branch name will be composed of the module that you are in, the part of the module if there are several, and an indication of which week it is. For example:

- the homework branch for javascript1 week2 would be `javascript-javascript1-week2`
- the homework branch for nodeJs week1 would be `nodejs-week1`
- the homework branch for react2 week3 would be `react-react2-week3`

## Before making a pull request

### Homework checklist

Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you carefully followed the homework instructions and completed all the tasks?
- [ ] Do the variable, function, and argument names follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Have you removed console.log, unnecessary comments and unused code?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/code_formatting.md))?

## Peer review pro tips

Give the review on the PR exactly how the mentors do it! You can see how to give feedback on a PR using github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request).

To help you get started with reviewing we have created [some resources](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/tree/main/review) about giving feedback.

[Why is it important](https://www.brightspot.com/blog/developer-life-5-reasons-why-the-code-review-process-is-critical-for-developers) to give feedback? Because it will make you a [better developer](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-importance-of-code-reviews/)! üí™ ü§ì
